# ‚ö° SQL Query Performance Optimization

This guide walks through improving query performance in a database that handles **Users**, **Bookings**, **Properties**, and **Payments**.  
We will:

1. Write an initial query to retrieve all booking data.  
2. Analyze the query‚Äôs performance using `EXPLAIN`.  
3. Identify inefficiencies.  
4. Add indexes to improve performance.  
5. Refactor the query for faster execution.  
6. Compare results before and after optimization.

## üß© Step 1: Initial Query ‚Äî Retrieve Bookings with All Related Details

üìÅ **File:** `performance.sql`

```sql
-- Retrieve all bookings with related user, property, and payment details
SELECT 
    b.booking_id,
    b.booking_date,
    b.status,
    u.user_id,
    u.full_name,
    u.email,
    p.property_id,
    p.property_name,
    p.city,
    pay.payment_id,
    pay.amount,
    pay.payment_date,
    pay.payment_status
FROM bookings b
JOIN users u ON b.user_id = u.user_id
JOIN properties p ON b.property_id = p.property_id
JOIN payments pay ON b.booking_id = pay.booking_id;

üîç Step 2: Analyze Query Performance with EXPLAIN

Use EXPLAIN or EXPLAIN ANALYZE to view how the database executes this query.

EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT 
    b.booking_id,
    b.booking_date,
    b.status,
    u.user_id,
    u.full_name,
    u.email,
    p.property_id,
    p.property_name,
    p.city,
    pay.payment_id,
    pay.amount,
    pay.payment_date,
    pay.payment_status
FROM bookings b
JOIN users u ON b.user_id = u.user_id
JOIN properties p ON b.property_id = p.property_id
JOIN payments pay ON b.booking_id = pay.booking_id;

üßæ Example Output (Before Optimization)
Seq Scan on bookings b   (cost=0.00..4200.00 rows=20000 width=128)
Seq Scan on users u      (cost=0.00..2500.00 rows=10000 width=96)
Seq Scan on properties p (cost=0.00..3500.00 rows=8000 width=64)
Seq Scan on payments pay (cost=0.00..2700.00 rows=20000 width=64)
Execution Time: 740 ms

‚ö†Ô∏è Step 3: Identify Inefficiencies
Issue	Description
‚ùå Sequential scans	Large tables scanned fully without indexes
‚ùå Too many columns	Fetching unnecessary data increases memory use
‚ùå Inner joins only	Fails when some bookings have no payment yet
‚ùå No indexing	Foreign keys lack supporting indexes
‚öôÔ∏è Step 4: Create Indexes to Speed Up Joins

Create indexes on the most frequently joined columns and save them in database_index.sql.

-- USERS TABLE
CREATE INDEX idx_users_user_id ON users (user_id);

-- BOOKINGS TABLE
CREATE INDEX idx_bookings_user_id ON bookings (user_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_bookings_property_id ON bookings (property_id);

-- PROPERTIES TABLE
CREATE INDEX idx_properties_property_id ON properties (property_id);

-- PAYMENTS TABLE
CREATE INDEX idx_payments_booking_id ON payments (booking_id);


üí° Why:
Indexes help the database find matching rows faster during JOIN, WHERE, and ORDER BY operations.

üß† Step 5: Refactor the Query to Reduce Execution Time

We‚Äôll:

Select only required columns.

Use LEFT JOIN for optional tables like payments.

Rely on our new indexes for faster lookups.

-- Optimized query
SELECT 
    b.booking_id,
    b.booking_date,
    b.status,
    u.full_name AS user_name,
    p.property_name AS property_name,
    pay.amount,
    pay.payment_status
FROM bookings b
JOIN users u ON b.user_id = u.user_id
JOIN properties p ON b.property_id = p.property_id
LEFT JOIN payments pay ON b.booking_id = pay.booking_id;


Optimization Summary:

üß© Reduced column selection ‚Üí less data fetched.

üîÅ Changed full joins to LEFT JOIN for optional data.

‚öôÔ∏è Added indexes to all join keys.

üöÄ Query simplified for better optimizer use.

‚ö° Step 6: Re-Test with EXPLAIN ANALYZE

Run the optimized query again with performance analysis.

EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT 
    b.booking_id,
    b.booking_date,
    b.status,
    u.full_name AS user_name,
    p.property_name AS property_name,
    pay.amount,
    pay.payment_status
FROM bookings b
JOIN users u ON b.user_id = u.user_id
JOIN properties p ON b.property_id = p.property_id
LEFT JOIN payments pay ON b.booking_id = pay.booking_id;

üßæ Example Output (After Optimization)
Index Scan using idx_bookings_user_id on bookings b   (cost=0.42..1200.55 rows=20000 width=96)
Index Scan using idx_bookings_property_id on properties p  (cost=0.55..800.33 rows=8000 width=64)
Index Scan using idx_payments_booking_id on payments pay   (cost=0.30..600.20 rows=20000 width=64)
Execution Time: 120 ms


‚úÖ Result:

Reduced from 740 ms ‚Üí 120 ms

Sequential scans replaced with Index Scans

Less I/O and faster joins

üìä Step 7: Compare Before & After
Metric	Before	After	Improvement
Execution Time	740 ms	120 ms	‚ö° ~84% faster
Scan Type	Sequential	Index	‚úÖ Optimized
Columns Selected	12	6	üí° Reduced data load
Joins	3 Inner	2 Inner + 1 Left	‚úÖ More flexible
üß© Step 8: Key Takeaways

Always index foreign keys and join columns.

Use EXPLAIN regularly to monitor performance.

Select only what you need ‚Äî every extra column adds cost.

Replace inner joins with LEFT JOINs when optional relationships exist.

Keep separate .sql files for indexing and query performance testing.

üìÅ Project Files
File	Purpose
performance.sql	Contains both initial and optimized queries
database_index.sql	Stores all index creation statements
performance_optimization.md	Documentation of the optimization process
